# Alarm_for_finishingLin
I had been performing some complex tasks in python and it took more than one hour to run.
So i thought to myself, why don't we do something to ping me when the program finish it's run?
I went through some internet links and collected some package names and put them an the bottom of my code as the last executed lines!
bingo! Have fun!
