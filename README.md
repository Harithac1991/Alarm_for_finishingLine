# Alarm_for_finishingLin
I was doing some complex tasks in python and it took more than one hour to run.
So i thought to myself, why don't we do something to alarm ourselves, when the program finish it's run?
I went through some internet links, collected some package names and put these codes in the bottom of my code as the lastly executed lines!
It Worked! Have fun!
